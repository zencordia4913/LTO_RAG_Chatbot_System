      "To decompose the query \"What are the requirements in getting a license?\" into three sub-queries and provide short answers for each, we need to consider the general process of obtaining a license, which can vary depending on the type of license (e.g., driver's license, professional license, etc.). However, there are common steps that apply broadly. Here's how we can break it down:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Meeting Eligibility Criteria**: The first step in getting any license is to meet the basic eligibility criteria set by the issuing authority. This often includes age requirements, residency, and sometimes background checks.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Completing Required Education or Training**: Many licenses require applicants to complete a specific course of study or training program. For example, a driver's license typically requires completing a driver's education course, while professional licenses might require a degree from an accredited institution.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Passing Examinations or Tests**: Nearly all licensing processes involve passing one or more exams or tests to demonstrate competency in the area the license is for. This could be a written test for a driver's license or a series of professional exams for a medical or legal license.\n",
      "\n",
      "Given these steps, here are the sub-queries and their respective answers:\n",
      "\n",
      "- **SUB-QUERY 1**: \"What are the eligibility criteria for getting a license?\"\n",
      "  - **ANSWER 1**: \"The eligibility criteria include meeting age requirements, residency, and sometimes passing background checks.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "- **SUB-QUERY 2**: \"What kind of education or training is required for licensing?\"\n",
      "  - **ANSWER 2**: \"Required education or training varies by license type but often includes completing specific courses or degree programs from accredited institutions.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "- **SUB-QUERY 3**: \"How do licensing exams or tests assess applicant competency?\"\n",
      "  - **ANSWER 3**: \"Licensing exams test knowledge, skills, and sometimes physical abilities relevant to the licensed activity, ensuring applicants can perform their duties safely and effectively.\"\n",
