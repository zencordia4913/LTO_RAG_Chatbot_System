The Chief of the Division was called the Superintendent of Division of Motor Vehicles. Act No. 3992 was amended by Commonwealth Act Numbers 123, 548, 556, 652 and Republic Act Numbers 314, 587, and 2383. On June 2, 1945, Department Order No. 4 was issued by the Department of Public Works and Highways reorganizing the Division. This took effect after the liberation of the Philippines from the Japanese invasion. In 1947, Executive Order No. 94 was promulgated reorganizing the different executive departments, bureaus and offices. Under Section 82 of this E.O., the Division of Motor Vehicles was upgraded into the Motor Vehicles Office (MVO) with the category of a Bureau. The Chief of the MVO enjoyed the rights and privileges of a Bureau Director. During the fifties and early sixties, our country started undergoing rapid economic development. Industrialization advanced and as a consequence, more and better roads were constructed. The Filipino then realized the need for mo...<br>"

Value '['The actual question is not directly stated in the provided text. However, I can infer a possible question that matches the topic of traffic and emergency response.\\n\\nBased on the context, it seems like the correct answer to the implied question \"Traffic Jam can be prevented if you\" would be:\\n\\n1. **Regular maintenance**: Regular vehicle maintenance can help prevent accidents and reduce congestion caused by breakdowns.\\n2. **Predictable traffic environment**: Creating a predictable traffic environment through proper road design, clear signage, and effective traffic management can also contribute to reducing traffic jams.\\n3. **Responsible driving habits**: Encouraging responsible driving habits, such as avoiding aggressive driving, following speed limits, and yielding to pedestrians, can also help prevent traffic congestion.\\n\\nHowever, since the actual question is not provided, I\\'ll assume a more fitting answer based on the topic:\\n\\n\"Regular maintenance\" is key to preventing traffic jams caused by vehicle breakdowns.', 'According to the given text, when making a right turn, you should:\\n\\n\"Keep as close as possible to the right-hand curve or edge of the highway.\"\\n\\nThis is mentioned in the section \"Illegal Turn\" under the subheading \"Failure of the driver of a motor vehicle intending to run to the right at an intersection to approach such intersection in the lane for traffic nearest to the right-hand side of the highway and, in turning, to keep as close as possible to the right-hand curve or edge of the highway.\"', 'According to Article IV, Section 45 of the Traffic Code (as mentioned in the text), when a driver intends to turn right or left at an intersection, they should give a signal \"plainly visible to the driver of such other vehicles\" of their intention to make such movement. This means that the driver should give a signal at least before turning, so other drivers can see it and adjust accordingly.\\n\\nSo, to answer your question: At least.', \"Based on the provided information, at an intersection with a traffic control device (such as a traffic light), you should yield to other vehicles and pedestrians lawfully within the intersection before proceeding. However, there is no specific mention of making a left turn only when the traffic light indicates it's safe.\\n\\nGiven this context, I will provide a generic answer based on standard traffic rules:\\n\\nAt an intersection with a traffic light, make a left turn only when the traffic signal allows you to do so, and after yielding to other vehicles and pedestrians lawfully within the intersection.\", 'The correct answer is:\\n\\nUsing a digitalized system, such as LEHMD (Law Enforcement Handbook for Mobile Data), which allows for transparent and accountable tracking of violations and transactions.\\n\\nAccording to the article, the LTO has introduced the LEHMD to facilitate cashless transaction options for traffic infractions and to reduce corruption. The device can issue machine-generated TOPs (e-TOP: electronic Temporary Operator Permit) and transfer information to the LTO system instantly, reducing the opportunity for bribery and corruption.\\n\\nTherefore, the correct answer is using a digitalized system like LEHMD to eliminate graft and corruption in the traffic enforcement system.', 'According to the provided text, on a multi-lane road with broken white center lines (not solid), overtaking or lane changes are allowed when safe to do so. However, since this is not the case in the question, we need to look at the option that says \"you can\".\\n\\nThe correct answer would be: Overtake\\n\\nSo, the response should be:\\n\\nA) Yes', 'According to the provided text, a double solid yellow line with a broken white line in between indicates that \"overtaking or crossing is prohibited\" for traffic coming from one direction. However, for traffic coming from the other direction, passing is permitted on the side of the broken line but not on the side of the solid line.', 'When making a U-turn, you should start turning from the right side of the innermost lane, check for traffic in both directions and make the proper turn signal, then carefully turn the steering wheel sharply to the left while moving forward.', 'Horizontal Alignment Markers.', \"Based on the provided text, it appears to be about road traffic signs in the Philippines.

In this case, according to traffic laws and regulations, a vehicle must come to a complete stop before traversing a \"through highway\" or railroad crossing.\\n\\nTo answer your actual question:\\n\\nA complete/full stop means bringing a vehicle to a momentary halt at a designated stopping point, typically marked by signs or signals. It is essential for ensuring the safety of pedestrians, other vehicles, and road users. A complete stop usually involves applying the brakes firmly, shifting into neutral (or parking) gear, and allowing the vehicle to come to rest before proceeding.\\n\\nPlease let me know if you need further clarification!', 'Based on the given context, I can infer that the correct answer is:\\n\\n**A designated passing zone**\\n\\nAccording to the provided text (points 16-23), there are specific rules and restrictions for overtaking or passing another vehicle on a highway.

A motor vehicle parks too close to a fire station entrance, which may result in disrupting the work of firefighters and causing more harm to others.\\n3. A motor vehicle is parked on the side of the road or sidewalk without authority.\\n\\nTherefore, the correct answer is: obstructing the passage of other vehicles or parking too close to a fire station entrance.\\n\\nHowever, since there are multiple options provided (A-D), I will rephrase my response:\\n\\nA) Obstructing the passage of other vehicles\\nB) Parking in front of a fire station\\nC) Parking on a sidewalk\\nD) Parking on an alley\\n\\nThe correct answer would be either A or B, as both are specific examples of parking violations mentioned in the text.', 'The correct answer to the query is:\\n\\n**No parking allowed**\\n\\nAccording to the ROAD AND TRAFFIC RULES, there are specific signs indicating where parking is not allowed.
