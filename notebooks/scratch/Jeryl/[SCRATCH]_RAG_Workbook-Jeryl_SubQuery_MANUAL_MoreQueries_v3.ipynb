      "1. **Understanding License Types**: The first step is to identify what type of license the user is referring to, as different licenses (e.g., driver's license, professional license, business license) have different requirements.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Educational Requirements**: Many licenses require applicants to complete specific educational courses or have certain degrees.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Examination and Assessment**: Most licensing processes involve passing an examination or assessment that tests the applicant's knowledge or skills in the relevant area.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Background Checks**: For some licenses, particularly those related to security, childcare, or healthcare, background checks may be necessary.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. **Application and Fees**: There's usually a formal application process involving paperwork and payment of fees.\n",
      "\n",
      "6. **Maintenance and Renewal**: Licenses often require ongoing education or renewal processes to remain valid.\n",
      "\n",

      "- SUB-QUERY 1: \"What are the different types of licenses and their specific requirements?\"\n",
