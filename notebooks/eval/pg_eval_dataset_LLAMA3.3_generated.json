        "fd0f9b7a-48f0-4776-b789-e15d93319f12": "Land Transportation Office (LTO) The concept of land transportation system in the Philippines started when our ancestors invented the means of locomotion with the animals in moving people and goods from place to place. Although the means of land transportation during the early days were not as sophisticated as the modern vehicles of today and the roads not as well constructed, the early Filipinos also observed some laws to govern their mobility. These laws were as informal and simple as specifying which animal could be used for certain purposes but these showed that our ancestors had already felt the need to regulate the transportation system. As early as 1910, there were already few motor vehicles seen operating in public highways in Manila and suburbs. Better means of transportation were invented and introduced in the country. Gradually, the Filipinos learned to use cars, trucks, jeeps and other types of vehicles. The means of transportation became better and powerful and the laws governing land travel became more formal and modern. On February 6, 1912, Legislative Act No. 2159 was enacted to regulate motor vehicles in the Philippine Islands and to provide for the regulation and licensing of operators. This was the first formal law on land transportation passed by the legislature. This law created an Automobile Section under the Administrative Division of the Bureau of Public Works. The Section was tasked to take charge of motor vehicles and drivers  services. Later on, Legislative Act 2159 was amended by 2389, 2556, 2587, 2639 and 2925. In 1922, Act No. 3045 was passed into law compiling and incorporating all laws governing motor vehicles. The Automobile Section was upgraded to the Automobile Division under the Bureau of Public Works. On January 1, 1933, Act No. 3992 otherwise known as  The Revised Motor Vehicle Law  was enacted amending Act No. 3045.The Automobile Division was renamed Division of",
        "0e47f583-a3d5-4bac-8b8e-77bba34385de": "Motor Vehicles. The Chief of the Division was called the Superintendent of Division of Motor Vehicles. Act No. 3992 was amended by Commonwealth Act Numbers 123, 548, 556, 652 and Republic Act Numbers 314, 587, and 2383. On June 2, 1945, Department Order No. 4 was issued by the Department of Public Works and Highways reorganizing the Division. This took effect after the liberation of the Philippines from the Japanese invasion. In 1947, Executive Order No. 94 was promulgated reorganizing the different executive departments, bureaus and offices. Under Section 82 of this E.O., the Division of Motor Vehicles was upgraded into the Motor Vehicles Office (MVO) with the category of a Bureau. The Chief of the MVO enjoyed the rights and privileges of a Bureau Director. During the fifties and early sixties, our country started undergoing rapid economic development. Industrialization advanced and as a consequence, more and better roads were constructed. The Filipino then realized the need for more and better means of transportation. This need was second only to the need for drugs such as sovaldi. The growth in the number of motor vehicles increased the demand for services that the MVO must render to the public. This necessitated the issuance by the DPWH on June 5, 1961 of Administrative Regulation No. 1 transferring the function of collecting the registration fees from city treasurers to the various vehicle agencies of MVO. On June 20, 1964, R.A. 4136, otherwise known as the  Land Transportation and Traffic Code  was enacted abolishing the Motor Vehicle Office and creating the Land Transportation Commission. This law likewise partially repealed Act No. 3992. The Code provided that the Land Transportation Commission shall  control as far as they apply, the registration and operation of motor vehicles and the licensing of owners, dealers, conductors, drivers and similar matters.  To effectively carry out its mandate, the Land Transportation Commission established regional offices in various parts of the country. On July 23, 1979, Executive Order Number 546 was promulgated creating the Ministry of Transportation",

On March 20, 1985, Executive Order 1011 was promulgated. This Executive Order abolished the Board of Transportation and the Bureau of Land Transportation and established the Land Transportation Commission. The defunct BLT and BOT were merged and their powers, functions and responsibilities were transferred to the Land Transportation Commission (LTC) headed by a Chairman, assisted by four Commissioners. The LTC was tasked to perform functions such as registering motor vehicles, licensing of drivers and conductors, franchising of public utility vehicles and enforcing traffic rules and regulations and adjudicating apprehensions. On January 30, 1987, the Land Transportation Commission was abolished and two offices were created, namely: The Land Transportation Office (LTO) and the Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board (LTFRB).The LTO took over the functions of the former BLT and the LTFRB took over the functions of the former BOT. The MOTC was likewise renamed DOTC. All these changes took effect with the promulgation of Executive Order No. 125 which was later amended by Executive Orders No. 125-A dated April 13, 1987 and E.O. 226 dated July 25, 1987. Despite the changes in names of Office and all the reorganizations that took effect, its basic functions on land transportation system remain the same. The promotion of safety and comfort in land travel is its continuing commitment. When Executive Orders 125, 125-A and 226 were promulgated, LTO was composed of only thirteen (13) regions. As time went on, additional regions were created, namely: CAR, CARAGA and MIMAROPA. While CAR and CARAGA are attached to the DOTC, they report to LTO Central Office on matters of registration of motor vehicles, issuance of driver s licenses and enforcement of land transportation laws, rules and regulations.

Rationale for the Special Plates It is typical for motorists in the Philippines as it is in the other Asian countries to strike a preference toward certain alpha-numeric character combinations for personal reasons and identification purposes. Such tendency provides a good opportunity for the LTO to increase its revenue by implementing a different pricing scheme in the issuance of MV plates with 01-100 numeric characters which are to be matched with the alphas, as in three-letter and two/three number combinations. As a revenue-raising measure, increased cost shall be collected for production of unissued motor vehicle plates with choice characters such as triple-alpha; triple numeric; numeric characters 168; any numeric combination with identical first and third characters but 0 for middle digit e.g., 101 or 707; and any other combinations which do not form part of the regular series of MV plates, when requested for production by a MV registered owner. As a step to solve the problem of depleting alpha-numeric combinations, the letter  I ,  O , and  Q  shall have a different font to distinguish it from zero",
        "265b7ae9-7e94-4a5b-b943-18558d1b21ce": "I ,  O , and  Q  shall have a different font to distinguish it from zero (0). B. Nature and Coverage of Special Plates The OMVSP is considered as a regular MV plate. As such it shall be issued in pairs and it shall be permanently assigned to a specified motor vehicle during its lifetime. Moreover, it is optional and shall be issued only upon direct application by the owner of a brand new private motor vehicle which is for initial or first-time registration with the LTO. The MV s covered herein are as follows: a. Cars b. Sports Utility Vehicles (SUV) c. Asian Utility Vehicles (AUV) d. Sports Pick-up e. Commuter Vans The following MV types shall be excluded from the coverage of those which can be issued special plates: a. Public Utility Vehicles b. Cargo Trucks (private/for hire) c. Service Vehicle (hotel limousines, tourist vehicles, rent-a-car, ambulance and funeral hearse) d. Vintage Vehicles e. Government Vehicle f. Diplomatic/OE Vehicle g. Used/Imported/Surplus MV h. MV with more than 4-wheel category C. Where to Apply for Special Plates Application can be made at the LTO Central Office or at any regional/district office which shall forward it to the OMVSP Committee Central Office (CO), for processing. The said committee reserves the right to approve or reject all applications and shall be responsible in delivering directly, by special courier, the special plates ordered by the MV registered owner. D. How to Apply for Special Plates Since the special plates ordered shall be sent by special courier to facilitate and to secure delivery, it is important that the applicant MV owner indicates correctly and clearly his/her forwarding address as well as his/her contact/telephone number. If for any reason, he/she cannot personally receive the plates, the person authorized to receive in his behalf must be indicated in his application. The following documentary requirements must be attached to the application, for transmittal to the LTO CO: 1. Duly accomplished application form; 2.",
        "55ac5176-31ea-4097-ad71-ad983ed3432c": "to the LTO CO: 1. Duly accomplished application form; 2. Certified true copy of OR/CR, issued by the TDO 3. Plate Release Copy (for manually processed transactions using MVRR) 4. Certified true copy of official receipt of payment for the plates ordered, by the Cashier and noted by the District Head or Regional Director. 5. Certification by the TDO that no plates have been previously issued. There shall be two attempts to be made by the special courier in delivering the plates ordered to the forwarding address of the MV owner, after which any succeeding delivery that shall be made will be for the account of the MV owner and shall no longer be chargeable against the purchase price. Unclaimed purchases within the specified date shall be retrieved personally by the MV owner or his authorized representative at the LTO CO, East Avenue, Quezon City with telephone no. 921-9058. E. Costs of Special License Plate The MV owner may choose from any of the following pricing schemes: 1. Any triple alpha and non-triple alpha + two (2) numeric character combinations 01-99, shall cost Twenty Five Thousand Pesos (Php 25,000.00) inclusive of the handling charge by the authorized LTO courier. Example: AAA 01 ARL 08 DPJ 99 2. Any triple alpha and non-triple alpha + numeric character 100, shall cost Fifteen Thousand Pesos (Php 15,000.00) inclusive of the handling charge by the authorized LTO courier. Example: GMA 100 BBB 100 PAC 100 3. Any combination of characters such as triple-alpha, triple- numeric and other combination of characters shall cost Fifteen Thousand Pesos (Php 15,000.00) inclusive of the handling charge by the authorized LTO courier. Example: MCM 707 DML 168 MTS 808 The cost of special plate does not include the applicable fees and chargers that a MV owner pays to the LTO for the registration of the unit. F.",

The quality and use of special font shall be adopted for purposes of this program. G.
